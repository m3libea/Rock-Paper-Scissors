# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is an app for the popular game Rock Paper Scissors. 

The App is implemented with three different ways to make the transition between two scenes. 

- Rock transition is entirely by code, here the storyboard is not used for that.
- Paper transition is fifty-fifty code and storyboard. We are using a manual segue.
- Scissors transition is entirely made in the Storyboard, except the part to transfer data between scenes. 

Here you can see a preview of it:
